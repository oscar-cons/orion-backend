# Security Documentation

## Overview

This document outlines the security measures implemented in the Orion Backend project and provides guidelines for secure deployment and operation.

## Security Measures Implemented

### ✅ Environment-Based Configuration
- All sensitive data (credentials, API keys) are loaded from environment variables
- No hardcoded secrets in source code
- Validation of required environment variables at startup

### ✅ Docker Security
- Non-root user execution in containers
- Minimal base images (python:3.11-slim)
- Health checks for service monitoring
- Resource limits to prevent DoS attacks

### ✅ Network Security
- Internal Docker network isolation
- Reverse proxy with rate limiting (nginx)
- Security headers implementation
- SSL/TLS support for production

### ✅ Input Validation
- FastAPI automatic request validation
- SQLAlchemy ORM to prevent SQL injection
- Type checking and validation

## Security Checklist

### Before Deployment
- [ ] Generate strong, unique passwords for database
- [ ] Obtain valid Google AI API key
- [ ] Configure environment variables securely
- [ ] Set up SSL certificates for production
- [ ] Configure firewall rules
- [ ] Set up monitoring and logging

### During Operation
- [ ] Regularly update dependencies
- [ ] Monitor logs for suspicious activity
- [ ] Rotate API keys periodically
- [ ] Backup database regularly
- [ ] Review access logs

## Environment Variables Security

### Required Variables
```bash
# Database Configuration
DB_USER=your_secure_username
DB_PASSWORD=your_very_secure_password_16_chars_min
DB_HOST=postgres
DB_PORT=5432
DB_NAME=inteligencia

# API Configuration
GOOGLE_API_KEY=your_google_api_key_here
```

### Password Requirements
- Minimum 16 characters
- Mix of uppercase, lowercase, numbers, and symbols
- Avoid common patterns and dictionary words
- Use different passwords for each environment

## Production Security Recommendations

### 1. Authentication & Authorization
- Implement JWT-based authentication
- Add role-based access control (RBAC)
- Use API key management for external integrations

### 2. Network Security
- Use VPN for database access
- Implement IP whitelisting
- Set up intrusion detection systems (IDS)

### 3. Monitoring & Logging
- Centralized logging (ELK stack)
- Real-time alerting for security events
- Regular security audits

### 4. Data Protection
- Encrypt data at rest
- Implement data backup encryption
- Regular security assessments

## Common Security Threats

### 1. SQL Injection
**Mitigation**: Using SQLAlchemy ORM prevents SQL injection attacks

### 2. Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)
**Mitigation**: FastAPI automatic input validation and sanitization

### 3. Rate Limiting
**Mitigation**: Nginx rate limiting (10 requests/second, burst 20)

### 4. Information Disclosure
**Mitigation**: No sensitive data in error messages or logs

### 5. Denial of Service (DoS)
**Mitigation**: Resource limits, rate limiting, health checks

## Incident Response

### Security Breach Response
1. **Immediate Actions**
   - Isolate affected systems
   - Preserve evidence
   - Notify stakeholders

2. **Investigation**
   - Analyze logs and system state
   - Identify attack vector
   - Assess data compromise

3. **Recovery**
   - Patch vulnerabilities
   - Restore from clean backups
   - Update security measures

4. **Post-Incident**
   - Document lessons learned
   - Update security procedures
   - Conduct security review

## Security Contacts

For security issues or questions:
- Create a private issue in the repository
- Include detailed description of the security concern
- Provide steps to reproduce if applicable

## Compliance

This project follows security best practices but may need additional measures for specific compliance requirements (GDPR, HIPAA, SOC2, etc.).

## Updates

This security documentation should be reviewed and updated regularly as the project evolves.
